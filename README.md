# Docker Recipes

Docker allows you to run whatever you want but it is not always evident how to achieve a specific goal.
This repository provides a few samples that you can use for educational and experimental purposes.

## Cron

The `cron` command-line utility is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems.
You can use it to run your tasks according to a schedule.
Cron is a relatively simple utility but configuring it for Docker can be a daunting task sometimes.
Unless you have a [working cron sample](cron) at hand.

## Try a Sample Yourself

You can use several approaches to run a specific sample:

- Run Docker on your machine
- Use a service that will do it for you in the cloud:
  - [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) (easiest)
  - [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)
